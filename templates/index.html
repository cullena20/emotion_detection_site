            <h3> What is this? </h3>
                <p class="explanation">
                    This webiste uses AI to analyze the emotion of people from their faces. Submit 
                    an image of people and get their emotions analyzed from their faces. The model
                    classifies faces as one of seven emotions: anger, disguist, fear, happiness, 
                    sadness and neutrality.
                </p>
            <h3> How does this work? </h3>
                <p class="explanation">
                    When you submit an image, it is run through a facial recognition model and then through
                    an emotion detection model that I built. The facial recognition model goes through the 
                    image and returns the areas of the image containing a face. It then preprocess the images
                    of the faces and runs them through the emotion detection model. The emotion detection model
                    was trained on the fer2013 database from Kaggle. You can check out the original competition
                    containing the database

            <h3> Warnings </h3>
                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>
                        When I tested this on my IPhone, no faces were detected in many images. I am honestly
                        not sure why as the images are in the correct format and are correctly converted to 
                        numpy arrays. This is probably an issue with the face_recongition library that I am
                        using to detect faces.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        This model can only accept jpg, jpeg, and png images. If you airdrop an image, it is saved as a
                        HEIC file and will not work through this model. Changing the extension name manually has not 
                        worked either in my experience. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This website only accepts images below 6 mb.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Somewhere in the time when an image is submitted, processed, and displayed, it is turned blue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the faces in the image are too small, the model can not properly resize them to perform the 
                        emotion analysis.
